# React-Tailwind profile

## Development

I wanted to test my abilites by building a profile using both react and Tailwind. I hadn't used Tailwind before and was excited to try.

I tried to use best practices for file organization and using components in React. I have a lot to learn but it was a good practice trying to keep these things in mind while writing this!

## Built With

- React
- Tailwind
